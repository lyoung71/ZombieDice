# ZombieDice

Description - My ZombieDice program simulates rounds of a game called ZombieDice. It relies heavily on an imported "zombiedice" module that was provided to me by Al Sweigart (https://github.com/asweigart/zombiedice/). I used Python classes to create several different bots that behave differently under different conditions.

Instructions - Users will need to make sure that they have downloaded and imported the zombiedice module before trying to run their own version of this program. It can be downloaded by simply typing "pip download zombiedice."

Credits - The tutorial that I used for this project can be found in chapter six of Al Sweigart's book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter6/).

NOTE: I did not write the code for "My Zombie Bot" which is shown in the image. I created the other bots though.
